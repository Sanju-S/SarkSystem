# SarkSystem
A Linux Bash like shell made using Python.

This scirpt provides basic functionality of unix shells like bash, sh, etc.
This script in no way provides all the high level or all the functionality of those shells!

I know the code may have a lot of bugs, some of which were able to hide from my eyes while some where kept by me.

It's just a fun little code written by me, just so that I can do a litlte time pass while I am try not to get bored.
