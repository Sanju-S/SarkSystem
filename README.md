# SarkSystem
A Linux Bash like shell made using Python.

This scirpt provides basic functionality of unix shells like bash, sh, etc.
This script i no way provides all the high level or all the functionality of those shells!

I know the code may have a lot of bugs, some of which were able to hide from m eyes while some where kept by me.

It's just a fun little  code written just so that I can do a litlte time pass while I am trying not to get bores.
