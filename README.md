# SarkSystem
A Linux Bash like shell made using Python.

You need no prior knowledge of python to run it, but to debug it??? sure you do.

This in no way is a complete replace for your beloved unix shell but a complete(yet noob style) rip off of one, written in python.
The development is still under progress (as everyone says).

Please use it, smash it, break it or whatever.
